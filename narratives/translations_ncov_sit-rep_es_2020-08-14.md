### La situación [fue resumida por la OMS el 2 de Agosto del 2020](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports):
\n\n
### **\"Al relajar las medidas de salud publica y de distanciamiento social, implementadas para limitar la transmisión del virus, muchos países han experimentado nuevos brotes o el resurgimiento de nuevos casos. Los riegos y las vulnerabilidades se han amplificado en contextos frágiles, de escasos recursos y afectados por conflictos.\"**
\n\n
### The worldwide sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has continued unabated, and with this data we use Nextstrain to track the geographic movement and evolution of the virus.
To date, there are over 75,000 sequences publicly shared from half the countries in the world - an amazing testament to the scientists and public health officials behind this.
\n\n
### We use subsampling approaches to remove potential sampling biases in order to ensure that regions and time-periods are appropriately included for analysis.
(This also helps for the computational requirements.)
\n\n
### Here you can see the geographical distribution of ~4300 genomes.
Each circle is centered on an individual country, the colour indicates region and the radius scales with the number of genomes from that country ([see here for help interpreting the map in Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/docs/visualisation/map-interpretation)).
\n\n
### In this report, we examine the global genomic epidemiology of COVID-19 broadly and provide specific updates for each world region.

# Resumen Ejecutivo

En este repote, analizamos genomas de SARS-CoV-2 compartidos públicamente. Al comparar estos genomas virales uno contra el otro, podemos caracterizar cómo el COVID-19 se está moviendo alrededor del mundo y esparciendo localmente.

- Asia tiene una proporción mas alta de los clados 19A y 19B, con los clados 20A, 20B y 20C dominando en Europa y América del Norte.

- Globalmente, podemos ver de forma clara el crecimiento hacia la prominencia de la sustitución D614G en la proteína Pico. Esta variante es hipotéticamente la responsable de un incremento en la transmisión del SARS-CoV-2.

- Para exhibir mejor versiones en tiempo real del SARS-CoV-2 alrededor del mundo, mantenemos 6 versiones regionales y 1 global, que son actualizadas cada día hábil de la semana.

- En Asia, existieron numerosas transmisiones entre países de la región durante el principio de la pandemia. Más recientemente observamos un movimiento hacia vínculos dentro de los países, una tendencia que se observe en gran parte de las regiones.

- En Oceanía, los casos de Nueva Zelanda están contenidos en una estrecha banda temporal, correspondiente a su eliminación del virus (hasta esta semana). El reciente aumento de caos de Australia aparece, al menos en las muestras compartidas hasta ahora, como un apretado cúmulo de casos provenientes de diversidades previamente circulantes.

- El SARS-CoV-2 se expandió extremadamente rápido en Europa - el virus estaba probablemente transmitiendose en muchos países antes de que se percataran. Esto ha resultado en una mezcla intensa de muestras al principio de la pandemia, haciendo dificil distinguir e identificar introducciones de un lugar a otro. Mas recientemente podemos observar variantes mas diferenciadas y asociadas con paises específicos, ya que los virus han sido contenidos a través de las restricciones de viaje.

- Al igual que otras regiones, América del Sur tuvo múltiples introducciones, cubriendo la mayor parte de la diversidad conocida del SARS-CoV-2. Luego de entrar en vigencia las restricciones de viaje, las secuencias comenzaron a agruparse de forma mas notoria. Desafortunadamente, y a pesar de las epidemias en curso en muchos paises, no hay disponibles secuencias mas recientes.

- África también ha tenido múltiples y diversas introducciones temprano en la pandemia. La restricciones de viaje subsiguientes parecen haber limitado la mezcla entre paises africanos, con la mayoría de las secuencias aparentemente derivando de circulaciones mas tempranos dentro del mismo país

- Una imagen diferente se observa en los EEUU, donde los viajes domésticos no han sido grandemente restringidos: observamos mezclas entre todos los Estados, al igual que transmisión local. En México y Centroamérica, observamos ejemplos de cúmulos geográficos de transmisión, particularmente entre California (EEUU) y Baja California (México).

# [Worldwide distribution of genetic variants](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-08-11?c=clade_membership&d=map&r=color)

Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has diversified into several different co-circulating variants. To facilitate discussion of these variants, we have grouped them into clades which are defined by specific signature mutations.

We currently define 5 major clades (see [this blog post](https://nextstrain.org/blog/2020-06-02-SARSCoV2-clade-naming) for details):

* 19A and 19B emerged in Wuhan and dominated the early outbreak.
* 20A emerged out of 19A, dominated the European outbreak in March, and has since spread globally.
* 20B and 20C are large, genetically distinct subclades of 20A.

We're now looking at the distribution of these clades across the world (the color now represents clade membership).
You can see that countries in the Asia region have a higher proportion of 19A and 19B (blues) as that variant dominated in the early outbreak.
Europe and North America have a mixture of all clades, but are dominated by 20B and 20C (yellow and orange, respectively).

#### If you have SARS-CoV-2 sequences for which you'd like to know their clade (and estimated position on a phylogenetic tree), we made Nextclade ([clades.nextstrain.org/](https://clades.nextstrain.org/)) which lets you drag-and-drop your FASTA files onto the browser.

# [The well-publicized D614G Spike Mutation](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-08-11?c=gt-S_614&d=tree,map&r=region&transmissions=hide&legendOpen)

The D614G substitution in the gene coding for the Spike (S) protein has been in the news recently and the topic of much speculation.

Evidence is building that the G variant (yellow in this view) increases infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 _in vitro_ and may have been evolutionarily selected for increased human-to-human transmission ([Korber et al.](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30820-5.pdf), [Zhang et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.148726v1.full), [Yurkovetskiy et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187757v2), [Daniloski et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.151357v2), [Volz et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166082v1)). However, an increase in infectivity may potentially come at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies ([Weissman et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159905v1)).

Here we can see that this variant was inferred to have appeared very shortly after the initial zoonosis and subsequently spread around the world.
In July the 614G variant was present in the majority of circulating viruses worldwide. Since its initial appearance, the substitution has arisen multiple times and also reverted back to the 614D variant.
There is no evidence that these other substitutions and reversions have resulted in continued transmission chains.

# [Analysing regional builds independently](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-08-11?&c=num_date&d=map&r=region&legendOpen&transmissions=show)

As there are too many genomes to show in a single tree, we provide a regional analysis for each of the 6 regions shown here, in addition to our main 'global' build.
This allows us to focus on the diversity within each region, while choosing appropriate out-of-region samples, so we can maintain an overview of all of the between-region transmissions over time - as we can see on this slide!

In the next slides we're going to provide an overview of each of those regions by switching to the corresponding dataset. (This is a new feature in Nextstrain Narratives!)

A full inventory of builds maintained by us and others is available at [nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2](https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/).

# [Asia situation pre-June](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-08-11?dmax=2020-06-01&d=map&f_region=Asia&legendOpen)

If we examine the situation in Asia from genomes collected before June 2020, we see signs of both extensive within-Asia transmission as well as transmissions to and from other regions of the world.

#### Interpreting the lines and colors

Here only countries in Asia have been colored, with the other regions represented by shades of grey.
The color of each transmission line (lines between circles) represents the origin location, so all of the **colored** lines represent transmissions originating from a country within Asia (in this example).

#### Transmissions into Asia

This shows that many of transmissions involving Asian and non-Asian countries were importations into Asia (grey lines).
Especially pronounced in this view are those transmissions from Europe to Asia (though the lines seem to come from Germany, this point represents all of Europe). However, we must be cautious about how we interpret these inferred transmissions, as sampling biases can play a large role (and we have many more samples from Europe than anywhere else).

# [Asia situation after June 1](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-08-11?d=tree,map&dmin=2020-06-01&f_region=Asia&legendOpen&p=grid)

Looking at the genomes sampled after June 1 (i.e. in the past 2 months), we see that the sampling is dominated by fewer countries.
This limits the conclusions we can draw, but it appears that we may have fewer transmissions between countries.

This is also evident looking at the phylogeny, where we have large monophyletic (in the same part of the tree) groupings of genomes from Singapore (yellow) and Bangladesh (light green).

These data are consistent with less recent international travel and stricter control measures.

# [Oceania overview](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/oceania/2020-08-11?d=tree,map&f_region=Oceania&legendOpen&p=grid&transmissions=hide)

Here we can explore ~790 genomes from Australia and New Zealand with an extra ~1100 sequences to provide global context.
Only samples from Australia and New Zealand are colored.

You can see that these samples are spread throughout the tree, indicating that Oceania has been exposed to (most of) the observed genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2.

The majority of New Zealand's samples (blues, purples, greens) come from a tight temporal band covering March and April, which is due to the successful control strategy employed by the New Zealand government. While the country is back to relative normality, the borders are still closed to all non-citizens to limit the chances for the virus to re-enter the country. Returning citizens must quarantine for 14 days before entering the country.

This week, the New Zealand government announced four new cases of community transmission which cannot be linked to arriving cases. Genetic sequencing may be able to help uncover how SARS-CoV-2 bypassed the strict controls -- more below!

# [Resurgence in Australia](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/oceania/2020-08-11?d=tree&dmin=2019-12-29&f_country=Australia&label=clade:20B&p=grid&transmissions=hide&legendOpen)

Australia, and the state of Victoria (capitol city: Melbourne), shown here in orange, have been seeing a reemergence of COVID-19 cases and have recently implemented further public health measures to try to curb this increase.

These most recent genomes all appear to be a subclade of clade 20B (scroll back to the previous slide to see how clade 20B fits into the entire phylogeny).
The recent dates and clustering are signs of a local outbreak.

We can see similar clustering in sequences from New South Wales, where cases have also increased recently.

# [New cases detected in New Zealand this week](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/oceania/2020-08-11?c=gt-nuc_10097,23731&d=tree)

New Zealand had reported over 100 days without community transmission before detecting cases in the community this week.
The cluster has now spread to around 30 known cases (at time of publication), primarily based in the largest city, Auckland.

The source is not yet known, however scientists have sequenced the isolates and reported that they fall into pangolin lineage B1.1.1; so while the genomes are yet to be released they are known to fall in the region colored in blue here.
This lineage originated in Europe, but has since been observed in multiple regions around the world.


<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Early situation in Europe](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/europe/2020-08-10?d=tree,map&f_region=Europe&p=grid&legendOpen&dmax=2020-02-29&dmin=2020-01-03&f_country=Belgium,Denmark,Finland,France,Germany,Greece,Iceland,Italy,Netherlands,Norway,Spain,Sweden,Switzerland,United%20Kingdom,Austria&transmissions=hide)

SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across Europe, likely primarily through direct transmissions from Asia.

By the end of February, even though there were just [a few hundred cases](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea) officially reported in Europe, the virus had spread to at least 15 European countries.

Given that sampling was less common in the early days of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was almost certainly already circulating across must of Europe, including in countries for which we don't have samples.


<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Lockdown in Europe](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/europe/2020-08-10?d=tree,map&f_region=Europe&p=grid&legendOpen&transmissions=hide&dmax=2020-04-28&dmin=2020-03-01&f_country=Finland,Iceland,Spain,Sweden,Switzerland)

Through March and April much of Europe closed their borders, and many imposed differing types of 'lockdown' where movement was restricted and businesses and schools closed. We expect that these restrictions decreased between-country transmission, making it more likely that we see sequences from any given country 'cluster' with previous sequences from that country.

However, SARS-CoV-2 was already so mixed across Europe that different variants of the virus were circulating across multiple countries. Most countries had numerous distinct variants circulating before lockdown that were related to the viruses circulating in other countries. This means the phylogenetic picture remains well-mixed even after borders closed (shown by multiple colors near each other on the tree).

However, we can see some signs of the local transmission that we would expect. Here, Finland and Sweden have a very distinct transmission cluster in green and orange (about 1/3 from the top), while Spain (dark blue) shows distinct local transmission at the bottom and top of the tree. Iceland (purple) and Switzerland (light blue) also show clusters of local transmission.

_Hint: You can expand the legend by clicking 'Country' at the top-left of the tree!_

# [Recent European sequencing highlights local transmission and enriches understanding of previous SARS-CoV-2 spread](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/europe/2020-08-10?d=tree&f_recency=3-7%20days%20ago,New,1-2%20days%20ago&f_region=Europe&p=full&legendOpen)

Examining only samples uploaded in the past week highlights two important points.

Firstly, we can see a tendency towards groupings of tips into mini-clusters. This indicates that within-country transmission is continuing to dominate - likely a product of the various regulations introduced throughout Europe. The virus continued to diversify genetically during the lockdown, but was more likely to be confined to one country, meaning we can often now better distinguish local 'variants' from those in other countries.

Some samples do not follow this trend of linking to other samples from the same country. Hovering over a country in the legend highlights tips in the tree from that country and will help identify such samples. For instance, in the middle of the tree, we can see some Swedish samples (green) nested within a larger Russian clade (red).
Given the heavy subsampling, we need to remain cautious to not over interpret putative between-country transmissions from this view.

Secondly, we can see that the tips have a large difference in horizontal spacing -- i.e. the samples submitted in the past week represent a sample collection time window extending back to early March.
The reasons for sequencing "old" genomes varies, but these samples help us fill in our understanding of viral evolution and geographical movement.

# [The early situation in South America](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/south-america/2020-08-10?d=tree&f_region=South%20America&p=full&legendOpen&dmax=2020-04-15)

South America's first SARS-CoV-2 sequences are from late February and early March, and are scattered across the tree, suggesting multiple introductions. As international travel decreased in March, we can see evidence of sustained local transmission in several countries.

Many of Brazil's (light green) sequences are part of two large clusters (near top of the tree), with some evidence that this variant also moved around the continent to Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina.

We can also see distinct clusters of transmission involving Colombia (orange), Chile (turquoise), Uruguay (lighter blue), and Argentina (darker blue) scattered through the tree.


<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [The more recent situation in South America](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/south-america/2020-08-10?d=tree&f_region=South%20America&p=full&legendOpen&dmin=2020-05-01)

Unfortunately, while SARS-CoV-2 continues spreading widely in South America, sequence generation has not kept pace. Though cases remain high across much of the continent, only 68 samples from 5 countries (Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Argentina, & Chile) have been shared since May.

Though our inferences are limited by the sparse sampling, in many cases these more recent samples nest within the earlier diversity sampled in the same country, or other South American countries. This suggests the varients circulating now are descendants of those introduced early in the epidemic.


<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [SARS-CoV-2 in Africa](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/africa/2020-08-11?d=tree,map&f_region=Africa&legendOpen&transmissions=hide&p=grid)

Like South America, Africa had several introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to the continent, many likely from Europe. This is shown by the spread of African samples across the tree - even samples from the same country include diverse variants.

We now have sequences from countries across Africa throughout the epidemic, though sequencing efforts seem to have declined slightly more recently.
South Africa has contributed a large proportion of the sequencing.


<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Clustering in Africa](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/africa/2020-08-11?d=tree&f_region=Africa&legendOpen&p=full&f_country=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo,Senegal,South%20Africa)

In the DRC, Senegal, and South Africa, we can see clear signs of local transmission, shown as clusters of sequences in the tree.
From Senegal and South Africa, we also have samples collected more recently.
These samples generally fall within the older diversity of the country, as we would expect from continued local transmission.

Though we must be cautious with our conclusions as they are greatly limited by highly biased sampling, the recent samples from Africa we have do not suggest continued importation of variants from elsewhere.
This finding likely reflects the continued restrictions in movement globally.

# [United States epidemic is a mixture of local and within-country transmission](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-08-11?d=tree,map&dmin=2020-04-15&f_country=USA&p=full)

Here we show genomes from the United States epidemic from April 15 to present day. In mid-April, all U.S. states were on lockdown. [States have since implemented heterogeneous reopening policies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html).

In this tree, just like in the trees for other regions, we see examples of local virus transmission as shown by similarly-colored tips clustering together over time. If you click, "Explore the Data Yourself", and filter the location to Yakima County, you can see a clear example of introduction and growth of genetically related viruses into this region of Washington State. (You can also [click here](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-08-11?d=tree,map&dmin=2020-04-15&f_country=USA&f_location=Yakima%20County&p=grid) to do this, but you will leave the narrative.)

However, on the tree, we  also see within-country transmission across the U.S. as shown by mixing of colors at the tree tips. On the map, within-country transmission looks like transmission lines extending between states. These observations are consistent with few domestic travel restrictions and states' reopening policies.

# [Central American sequencing shows geographically-clustered transmission](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-08-11?d=tree,map,entropy&f_country=Belize,Costa%20Rica,Guatemala,Jamaica,Mexico,Panama&p=grid&transmissions=hide)

There has been limited sequencing from Central America, especially over the past two months, which restricts the inferences we can draw about the epidemic. From the genomes that have been shared, we see geographic clustering of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Toward the bottom of the tree in clade 19B, we see a cluster of transmission in Panama starting in mid-February. Several later sequences in Panama from June and July nest in with this cluster, suggesting there's continued local transmission of this virus genotype in the country.

In Mexico, we also see clear geographic clustering of transmission through May. Without more recent sequencing, we cannot make inferences about the epidemic in later months.

In the center of the tree, there is a cluster of cases in Baja California (in light blue). These cases were likely imported from California, USA (green branches on the tree) in March. This inferred importation is consistent with known travel links between the neighboring locations although we should be cautious about interpreting inferred transmission locations given sparse sequencing.

# [Closing summary](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-08-11?d=map)

As the pandemic reaches its eighth month of global circulation, we can now see distinct changes over time in the picture painted by viral genetics, largely determined by changing behaviour.

Multiple early transmissions to the USA, Oceania, Europe, and across Asia, were initially incredibly well-mixed, as our global travel patterns distributed the virus incredibly effectively. Soon afterwards, diverse introductions to South America and Africa, often from Europe and North America, seeded local epidemics there.

As the scale of the viral spread and severity of COVID-19 became apparent, travel ground to a halt in much of the world. After this point, we can see a distinct shift to local transmission during 'lockdowns' and the most severe travel restrictions. One outcome of this is that we can now sometimes better identify the source for viruses, as local epidemics have in some cases become more genetically distinct. In the USA, the absence of strict domestic travel has helped maintain well-mixed epidemics between states.

Borders are now re-opening and travel has resumed, though not nearly to pre-pandemic levels. This, combined with the lag time from when samples are taken to when they are available publicly, means we only see a few signs of between-country mixing. In general, recent samples tend to continue to cluster with past sequences from the same country, indicating continued transmission of previously circulating variants. 

Unfortunately, many countries have seen a rise in cases in the last few weeks, usually associated with reopening. As the Northern Hemisphere prepares to move into autumn and colder weather, further reopening, and school resuming, we must remain vigilant about rising case counts. As winter progresses in the Southern Hemisphere, we see worrying signs that seasonality could indeed lead to more trouble containing transmission - Australia's initial success with the virus has been dampened by recent outbreaks. Continuing to scale up Test, Trace, and Isolate, careful hand-hygiene, and conscientious mask-wearing can help keep our societies as open as possible while we continue to battle SARS-CoV-2.
